* zpresent tutorial!
** Welcome to zpresent.
** This is a way to present org files.
*** They can be presented inside Emacs! (Yay!)
*** But in a way that looks like traditional presentation software.
** Now, press `n` to go to the next slide.
* going forwards
** You can also press `C-n`.
* Keep moving!
** Or `right`, or `down`.
* back...to the future!
** To move to the previous slide, press any of these keys:
:PROPERTIES:
:child-bullet-type: .
:END:
*** `p`
*** `C-p`
*** `left`
*** `up`
** Try those, then when you're done, go to the next slide.
* You can also navigate to the beginning and end of the presentation
** To the beginning with `home`
** To the end with `end`.
** Try going to the beginning, then coming back here.
* Slides don't always show up all at once.
** They can have multiple parts.                                      :slide:
** And they can show up one at a time,                                :slide:
** Or,
** On the other hand,
** A group can show up.
* Different formatting
:PROPERTIES:
:child-bullet-type: .
:END:
** We can have ordered lists!
** They can show up with periods.
** Or with parens.
* Even title slides!
:PROPERTIES:
:type:     title
:author:   the author
:date:     today
:END:
* End!
** That's all! You can look at this file to see what an input file to zpresent is like.
