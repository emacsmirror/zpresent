** Now, press `n` to go to the next slide.
* going forwards
** You can also press `C-n`.
* Keep moving!
** Or `right`, or `down`.
* back...to the future!
** To move to the previous slide, press any of these keys:
:PROPERTIES:
:child-bullet-type: .
:END:
*** `p`
*** `C-p`
*** `left`
*** `up`
** Try those, then when you're done, go to the next slide.
* You can also navigate to the beginning and end of the presentation
** To the beginning with `home`
** To the end with `end`.
** Try going to the beginning, then coming back here.
* End!
** That's all! You can look at this file to see what an input file to zpresent is like.
